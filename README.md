## Project for the course of Digitali Innovation Lab 2019 - Polimi

In this project we developed a solution for a real-world case which has been assigned to us. We had to face the problem from a 360 degrees prospective, facing the following steps:
- Gather data and infos about the case.
- Develop a complete Business Model solution.
- Analyse the data and use insights to support our solution.
- Create a Prototype

**"TOP OF THE ROCK"** was the case assigned to us and the solution that we proposed is explained in the documentation_final.pdf.



*My main contribution to the project was to develop the data analysis models.*
